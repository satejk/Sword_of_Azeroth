# Sword_of_Azeroth
Its a text based RPG game I am building 
This game is based on the tutorial provided by http://www.penguinprogrammer.co.uk/rpg-tutorial-2/
which is under a MIT license.

My code will be under the same license as well as a GNU General Public License (GPL).

Well I am busy these days with writing project reports so this particular project has a low priority but i will definitely get 
back to it as i find time.
